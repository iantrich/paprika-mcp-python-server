# 🌶️ Paprika MCP Server

A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that lets you talk to [Paprika Recipe Manager](https://www.paprikaapp.com/) through Claude Desktop. Just chat naturally to add recipes, manage your grocery lists, plan your meals, or find that thing you made last week.

Oh, and it can generate food photos for your recipes too (using Flux from Black Forest Lab) if you want them to look fancy.

## What it does

- **Just talk to add recipes** - No forms, no clicking around. Describe it and it's saved
- **Manage grocery lists** - Add items, track quantities with units (e.g., "4 kilos", "3 liters"), and clear lists
- **Plan your meals** - Add recipes to your meal plan with fuzzy name matching and flexible date parsing
- **AI food photos** - Automatically generates images with Flux (~$0.002/image, totally optional)
- **Find stuff fast** - Search by ingredient, cooking time, or just random words you remember
- **Update anything** - Change one field or rewrite the whole thing
- **Syncs everywhere** - Everything updates in your Paprika apps automatically, you see the same thing on your computer, phone, or tablet.

## Quick Start

### What you need

- Python 3.10+ (probably already have it)
- [Paprika Recipe Manager](https://www.paprikaapp.com/) with cloud sync turned on
- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download), [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.ai/docs/claude-code), or any other MCP client

### Installation

Two commands and you're done:

```bash
pipx install paprika-mcp
paprika-mcp setup
```

The setup wizard will ask for your Paprika login, find your MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, etc.), and configure everything automatically.

That's it. Restart your MCP client and you're ready to go.

### Manual setup (if you prefer)

If you want to configure things yourself:

**Install:**
```bash
pipx install paprika-mcp
```

**Configure Claude Desktop** - Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "paprika": {
      "command": "pipx",
      "args": ["run", "paprika-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "PAPRIKA_USERNAME": "your_email@example.com",
        "PAPRIKA_PASSWORD": "your_password",
        "REPLICATE_API_TOKEN": "optional_token_for_images"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Other MCP clients** (Claude Code, VS Code, Cursor, etc.) use the same config structure, just different file locations.

Restart your MCP client (full quit and reopen).

## How to use it

Just talk to Claude like you're texting a friend about recipes:

**Create recipes:**
```
Create a Spaghetti Carbonara recipe with:
- 400g spaghetti, 4 eggs, 100g pancetta, 50g Parmesan, black pepper

Instructions:
1. Cook pasta, fry pancetta until crispy
2. Beat eggs with Parmesan
3. Mix hot pasta with pancetta, add eggs off heat
4. Season and serve

Servings: 4, Prep: 10 mins, Cook: 15 mins
```

**Search and filter:**
```
Show me all pasta recipes sorted by prep time
Find recipes with chicken and tomatoes
What can I make in under 30 minutes?
```

**Update recipes:**
```
Change the Carbonara recipe to serve 6 people
Add "Use room temperature eggs" to the notes
Update just the prep time to 15 minutes
```

**Regenerate images:**
```
Regenerate the Carbonara image with rustic style and darker lighting
Create a new photo with close-up view and more cheese visible
```

**Grocery lists:**
```
What grocery lists do I have?
What's on my grocery list?
Add 3 kilos of bananas to my grocery list.
How many bananas are on my grocery list?
Subtract 2 kilos of sugar from my grocery list.
```

![Adding to grocery list](images/demo-add-to-grocerylist-cursor.png)

**Meal planning:**
```
Add pasta bolognese to my meal plan for tomorrow
Add the Spaghetti Carbonara recipe to the meal plan for 15 November
Remove pasta bolognese from my meal plan
What does my meal plan look like for the next 2 weeks?
Show me all dinners planned for this week
```

## CLI Commands

Besides running as an MCP server, there are some handy commands:

```bash
# Run the MCP server (this happens automatically when MCP clients call it)
paprika-mcp

# Interactive setup wizard
paprika-mcp setup

# Reconfigure your credentials
paprika-mcp config

# Test if your Paprika login works
paprika-mcp test

# See recent logs from Claude Desktop
paprika-mcp logs

# Show version
paprika-mcp version

# Serve over HTTP instead of stdio (see below)
paprika-mcp serve-http
```

## HTTP transport (`serve-http`)

Most clients launch the server over stdio and you never think about it.
`serve-http` instead serves the same 17 tools over streamable HTTP at
`POST /mcp`, so a remote agent can reach it. There is also a `GET /healthz`.

```bash
# Defaults: --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080
paprika-mcp serve-http

# Bind elsewhere
paprika-mcp serve-http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9000

# Allow a browser-based client from a specific origin (repeatable).
# Loopback origins are already allowed; non-browser clients send no Origin
# header and are never blocked, so a tunnel works without this flag.
paprika-mcp serve-http --allowed-origin https://app.example.com
```

> **⚠️ This endpoint is UNAUTHENTICATED.** Anyone who can reach it can read,
> create and **delete** your recipes and clear your grocery list. Authentication
> is a later phase. Until it lands, do not expose this port to the internet —
> keep it on `127.0.0.1`, and if you must reach it remotely, put it behind a
> tunnel or proxy that does the authenticating for you.
>
> As a partial defence, requests carrying a cross-origin `Origin` header are
> rejected with 403, which stops a DNS-rebinding attack from a web page you
> happen to visit. That is not a substitute for auth: it does not stop anything
> that isn't a browser.

## AI Image Generation

By default, new recipes get an AI-generated photo using [Flux](https://blackforestlabs.ai/flux-1-tools/) from Black Forest Lab (via [Replicate](https://replicate.com)). You'll need a Replicate account and API token.

**Setup:**
1. Make an account at [replicate.com](https://replicate.com)
2. Grab your API token from [replicate.com/account/api-tokens](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens)
3. Add `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` to your Claude Desktop config (see above)

**Cost:** Around $0.002 per image (pretty cheap)

**Don't want images?**
```
Create a recipe without generating an image
```

**Make it look better:**
```
Regenerate image for "Pasta Carbonara" with: overhead view, rustic style, darker background
```

## Works with Multiple MCP Clients

This server works with any MCP-compatible client, not just Claude Desktop:

- **Claude Desktop** - The desktop app
- **Claude Code** - CLI tool for coding projects
- **VS Code** - With the MCP extension
- **Cursor** - AI code editor
- **Windsurf** - Another AI editor
- **Goose** - Terminal-based AI assistant
- Any other tool that supports MCP

The setup wizard (`paprika-mcp setup`) will find and configure any of these automatically.

## Advanced Features

### Brief Ingredients Pattern

You can add quick ingredient lists to recipe descriptions so you don't have to dig through the measurements:

```
Ingredients: Spaghetti, Pancetta, Eggs, Parmesan, Pepper

Classic Roman pasta with silky egg sauce and crispy pancetta.
```

Makes it way easier to check if you have everything before you start cooking.

### Pagination and Sorting

Got a ton of recipes? You can page through them and sort however you want:

```
Show me recipes 50-100 sorted by name
List the next 20 recipes starting from position 40
Sort recipes by prep time, quickest first
```

### Field Selection

Don't need everything? Just ask for the fields you want:

```
Show just recipe names and UIDs
List recipes but exclude directions and notes
```

### Mix it up

You can combine all this stuff:

```
Find recipes with "chicken", sort by prep time, show first 10 with only name and ingredients
```

## When stuff breaks

### Can't log in

**Error: Authentication failed**
- Make sure your login works at [paprikaapp.com](https://paprikaapp.com)
- Cloud sync needs to be on in your Paprika app
- Double-check you typed your credentials right in the config

### Claude can't see the server

**Connection issues**
- Use full paths in the config (no `~/` shortcuts)
- Point to your venv's Python: `/full/path/to/venv/bin/python`
- Actually quit Claude Desktop (Cmd+Q on Mac) and reopen it

**Import errors**
- Activate your virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
- Reinstall everything: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Image problems

**No images showing up**
- Check that `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` is in your Claude Desktop config
- Make sure your token works at [replicate.com/account](https://replicate.com/account)
- Don't worry, your recipe still saves fine without the image

**Images look wrong**
- Try `regenerate_recipe_image` with better instructions
- Be specific: "less sauce", "more garnish", "darker background"

### Check the logs

If something's really broken, look at the logs:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\Logs\mcp*.log`
